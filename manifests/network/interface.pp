# == Class: freebsd::src
#
# This code is meant to configure a *physical* interface on a FreeBSD system.
# You should be able to set the v4 and v6 addresses, as well as set the MTU
# for a given interface.
#
# You may also wish to only set the MTU and bring up the interface, which can
# be useful when you want ot assign a given interface to a lagg, but also
# want a custom MTU.
#
# An option is provided here for $alias.  This is used to add virtual
# addresses to a physicial interface.
#
# == Paramaters
#
# [*address*]
#   The IPv4 address to assign to the interface (CIDR notation).
# [*v6address*]
#   The IPv6 address to assign to the interface (Prefix Notation).
# [*mtu*]
#   Set the MTU of the physical interface.
# [*is_alias*]
#   Aliases are addresses in addition to the primary (bool)
# [*description*]
#   An interface label
#
# == Examples
#
#  class { "freebsd::interface":
#    address   => '10.127.0.1/30',
#    v6address => '2001:dead:beef:1::/64',
#    mtu       => '9000',
#  }
